Migrate an old-style configuration and binding table to the new YANG
configuration.  LWAFTR.CONF should be the name of an old lwAFTR
configuration.  Available VERSION values are:

  legacy
    Configuration from pre-v3.0.0 lwAFTR.
  3.0.1
    lwAFTR versions where "container" nodes in schemas are missing
    corresponding nodes in the data unless "presence true" is
    specified.
  3.0.1.1
    lwAFTR development snapshot where "br" fields of softwires were
    0-based instead of 1-based.
  3.2.0
    lwAFTR versions where "br" fields were indexes for the "br-address"
    leaf-list instead of "br-address" IPv6 entries on the softwire.

The default version is "legacy".

The resulting up-to-date configuration will be printed on standard
output, ready to be saved to a new file.
