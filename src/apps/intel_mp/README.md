# Intel i210 / i350 / 82599 Ethernet Controller apps (apps.intel_mp.intel_mp)

The `intel_mp.Intel` app provides drivers for Intel i210/i250/82599 based
network cards. The driver exposes multiple receive and transmit queues that can
be attached to separate instances of the app on different processes.

The links are named `input` and `output`.

## Caveats

If attaching multiple processes to a single NIC, performance appears
better with `engine.busywait = false`.

The `intel_mp.Intel` app can drive an Intel 82599 NIC at 14 million pps.

## Configuration

— Key **pciaddr**

*Required*. The PCI address of the NIC as a string.

— Key **ndesc**

*Optional*. Number of DMA descriptors to use i.e. size of the DMA
transmit and receive queues. Must be a multiple of 128. Default is not
specified but assumed to be broadly applicable.

— Key **rxq**

*Optional*. The receive queue to attach to, numbered from 0. The default is 0.
When VMDq is enabled, this number is used to index a queue (from 0 to 3)
for the selected pool.

— Key **txq**

*Optional*. The transmit queue to attach to, numbered from 0. The default is 0.

— Key **vmdq**

*Optional*. A boolean parameter that specifies whether VMDq (Virtual Machine
Device Queues) is enabled. When VMDq is enabled, each instance of the driver
is associated with a *pool* that can be assigned a MAC address or VLAN tag.
Packets are delivered to pools that match the corresponding MACs or VLAN tags.
Each pool may be associated with several receive and transmit queues.

For a given NIC, all driver instances should have this parameter either
enabled or disabled uniformly. If this is enabled, *macaddr* must be
specified.

— Key **poolnum**

*Optional*. The VMDq pool to associated with, numbered from 0. The default
is 0.

— Key **macaddr**

*Optional*. The MAC address to use as a string. The default is a wild-card
(i.e., accept all packets).

— Key **vlan**
*Optional*. A twelve-bit integer (0-4095). If set, incoming packets from
other VLANs are dropped and outgoing packets are tagged with a VLAN header.

— Key **rsskey**

*Optional*. The rsskey is a 32 bit integer that seeds the hash used to
distribute packets across queues. If there are multiple levels of RSS snabb
devices in the packet flow making this unique will help packet distribution.

— Key **wait_for_link**

*Optional*. Boolean that indicates if `new` should block until there is a link
light or not. The default is `false`.

— Key **linkup_wait**

*Optional* Number of seconds `new` waits for the device to come up. The default
is 120.

— Key **mtu**

*Optional* The maximum packet length sent or received, excluding the trailing
 4 byte CRC. The default is 9014.

— Key **master_stats**

*Optional* Boolean indicating whether to elect an arbitrary app (the master)
to collect device statistics. The default is true.

— Key **run_stats**

*Optional* Boolean indicating if this app instance should collect device
statistics. One per physical NIC (conflicts with `master_stats`). There is a
small but detectable run time performance hit incurred. The default is false.


### RSS hashing methods

RSS will distribute packets based on as many of the fields below as are present
in the packet:

* Source / Destination IP address
* Source / Destination TCP ports
* Source / Destination UDP ports

### Default RSS Queue

Packets that are not IPv4 or IPv6 will be delivered to receive queue 0.

### Hardware limits

Each chipset supports a differing number of receive / transmit queues:

* Intel82599 supports 16 receive and 16 transmit queues, 0-15
* Intel1g i350 supports 8 receive and 8 transmit queues, 0-7
* Intel1g i210 supports 4 receive and 4 transmit queues, 0-3

The Intel82599 supports both VMDq and RSS with 32/64 pools and 4/2 RSS queues for
each pool. This driver only supports configurations with 32 pools/4 queues.
While the i350 supports VMDq, this driver does not currently support it.
